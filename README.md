# What is it

Just a test web site, meant to wireframe a lighter but still fully-featured
portal for Navy HR applications.

Right now it's just static HTTP and other content. I anticipate trying to play
with client-side JS to maintain the ability to keep the content itself static
(read: servable from S3), but it may end up being easier to turn this into a
Node.js / Express or Ruby on Rails app (especially since RoR seems to be the
direction the U.S. Web Design Standards goes).

## Testing

You'll want to install Ruby Gems, Bundler, and Jekyll. If you install the first two
then the normal [directions for setting up a Jekyll theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
should be sufficient to take you the rest of the way.

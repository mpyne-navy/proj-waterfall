# What is it

Just a test web site, meant to wireframe a lighter but still fully-featured
portal for Navy HR applications.

Right now it's just static HTTP and other content. I anticipate trying to play
with client-side JS to maintain the ability to keep the content itself static
(read: servable from S3), but it may end up being easier to turn this into a
Node.js / Express or Ruby on Rails app (especially since RoR seems to be the
direction the U.S. Web Design Standards goes).

## Testing

For now, just run an HTTP server in the server root (e.g. `python3 -m http.server`)
or look at https://mpyne-navy.github.io/proj-waterfall/ which should be reflective
of the `master` branch of this Github repository.
